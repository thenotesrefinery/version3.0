        <p>thenotesrefinery owns and operates this website. We are committed to the privacy and security of our
            visitors' information. The following is a statement of our privacy practices:</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Website Visitors</h3>
        <p>Like most website operators, thenotesrefinery collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort
            that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference,
            referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. thenotesrefinery's purpose in collecting
            non-personally identifying information is to better understand how thenotesrefinery's visitors use its
            website. From time to time, thenotesrefinery may release non-personally-identifying information in the
            aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
        <p>thenotesrefinery also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP)
            addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on thenotesrefinery.com blogs/sites.
            thenotesrefinery only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that
            it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP
            addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the
            comment was left.</p>

        <h3>Gathering Of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>Certain visitors to thenotesrefinery's websites choose to interact with thenotesrefinery in ways that require
            thenotesrefinery to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
            thenotesrefinery gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up
            at thenotesrefinery.com to provide a username and email address. Those who engage in transactions with
            thenotesrefinery are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and
            financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, thenotesrefinery collects such
            information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction
            with thenotesrefinery. thenotesrefinery does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as
            described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the
            caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>

        <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
        <p>thenotesrefinery may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. thenotesrefinery may
            display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, thenotesrefinery does not disclose
            personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>

        <h3>Protection Of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
        <p>thenotesrefinery discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to
            those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in
            order to process it on thenotesrefinery's behalf or to provide services available at thenotesrefinery's
            websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and
            affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using thenotesrefinery's websites,
            you consent to the transfer of such information to them. thenotesrefinery will not rent or sell potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees,
            contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, thenotesrefinery discloses potentially
            personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or
            other governmental request, or when thenotesrefinery believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
            necessary to protect the property or rights of thenotesrefinery, third parties or the public at large. If
            you are a registered user of an thenotesrefinery website and have supplied your email address,
            thenotesrefinery may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback,
            or just keep you up to date with what's going on with thenotesrefinery and our products. If you send us a
            request (for example via email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in
            order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. thenotesrefinery
            takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or
            destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

            profile during a web session. This mechanism is employed solely for your convenience and for no other
            purpose.</p>

        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>This Web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we, thenotesrefinery, are not responsible
            for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our visitors to be aware when they leave our

            information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>

        <p>We do everything in our power to protect user-information off-line. All of our customers' information, not
            just the sensitive information mentioned above, is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the
            information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative)
            are granted access to personally identifiable information. Finally, the servers that store personally
            identifiable information are in a secure environment, in a locked facility.</p>
        <p>If visitors have any questions about the security on https://thenotesrefinery.com, feel free to contact
            Customer Service.</p>
        <h3>Correcting, Updating, Deleting &amp; Deactivating Personal Information</h3>
        <p>If a visitor's personally identifiable information changes (such as zip code, phone, email or postal
            address), or if a visitor no longer desires our service, we provide a way to correct, update or
            delete/deactivate personally identifiable information. This can usually be done at the ‘Your Account' page
            or by contacting our Customer Service.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Notification of Changes</h2>
        <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes to this privacy statement, the
            homepage, and other places we deem appropriate so our visitors are always aware of what information we
            collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it.</p>
        <p>If, however, we are going to use visitors' personally identifiable information in a manner different from
            that stated at the time of collection we will notify users by posting a notice on our web site for 30
            days.</p>
